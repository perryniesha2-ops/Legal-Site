    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> {{10-24-2025}}</p>
    <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of {{Scouta}}’s websites, apps, and services (“Service”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your region) and have the legal capacity to enter a contract. You are responsible for your account credentials and for all activity under your account.</p>

    <h2>2. Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
    <p>Paid features may require a subscription. Prices, features, and limits may change with notice as required by law. Taxes may apply. By starting a subscription, you authorize {{PAYMENT_PROCESSOR}} to charge your payment method. You can cancel at any time; cancellations apply at the end of the current billing period. Refunds are provided where required by law.</p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not misuse the Service (e.g., spam, malware, scraping at scale, reverse engineering except as permitted, or illegal activities).</li>
      <li>Respect others’ rights and applicable laws.</li>
      <li>We may investigate violations and suspend or terminate accounts to protect the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Content</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of content you submit. You grant {{COMPANY_NAME}} a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, process, and display your content solely to provide and improve the Service. You represent that you have necessary rights to the content you submit.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including software, design, and content, is protected by IP laws. Except for your content and any open-source components, all rights are reserved by {{COMPANY_NAME}}. You may not use our trademarks, logos, or branding without our prior written permission.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may link to or integrate third-party services. We are not responsible for third-party content, policies, or practices.</p>

    <h2>7. AI/Automation Features (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>Outputs may be autogenerated and could be inaccurate. You are responsible for reviewing outputs before use. Do not rely on outputs for medical, legal, or financial advice without professional verification.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, {{COMPANY_NAME}} AND ITS SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold {{COMPANY_NAME}} harmless from claims arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or if needed to protect the Service.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of {{GOVERNING_LAW_JURISDICTION}} without regard to conflict of laws rules. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of {{DISPUTE_VENUE}} unless otherwise required by law. If you reside in a region requiring arbitration or a different venue, your local mandatory rights apply.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms. We will revise the “Effective date” and, where material, provide notice as required by law. By continuing to use the Service after changes take effect, you accept the updated Terms.</p>
